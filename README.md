ðŸŒ± Arctic Foxes Blog App built in React using Bootstrap ðŸŒ±

In the project directory('/isatis_technical_task'), you can run:

### `npm start`

Open Arctic Fox blog to view it in your browser.

## Created fake Mock RESTApi with "json-server" package, installed with npm

### Simulated database with json-server.

### Go inside "/server-api" folder and run 'npm start' for runing JSON server on "localhost:3006/foxes"

In the terminal we can see all the changes regarding the requests that are sent, as well as whether any of the requests failed (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

## Used Bootstrap classes for more efficient and quick UI deployment

Enjoy and have fun with Arctic Foxes!!! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
